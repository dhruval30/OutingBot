# **OutingBot** 

Sure, I could have just filled out the outing form manually every week, but whereâ€™s the fun in that? This Python script uses landmark detection to automate the whole thing, because, well... Iâ€™m just nerdy like that. Itâ€™s not even that tough of a project, but, why not make life a bit more automated?

## **Whatâ€™s This?**

This little tool uses **OpenCV** to update the dates on my university outing form. Sure, I could write the dates myself, but where's the fun in that when I can get Python to do it for me? 

Upload your outing form image, type in the dates you plan to leave and return, and there â€“ the form is updated for you.

## **How It Works:**

1. **Upload your outing form image** (JPEG/PNG).
2. **Input your departure, return, and form fill dates**.
3. **Click "Update Dates"**.
4. **Download your freshly updated form**.

## **Why Did I Make This?**

**Itâ€™s not hard, but itâ€™s cool to tell people, "I have a Python script for that." ðŸ˜Ž**
